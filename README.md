# My small news app

## Introduction

This news app was made for the Cloud Computing course at CentraleSup√©lec, in
order to demonstrate my ability to create and deploy Docker images to DockerHub.
It is composed of two services: a frontend made in React with TypeScript, and a
backend made in Python Flask. It uses the news API (https://newsapi.org/) in
order to fetch the latest news from plenty of sources, and allows the user to
filter these news according to several categories and by country (only France,
Germany, UK and USA are implemented in this early version).

## Installation

In order to install the app, clone this repository by entering the following
command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone
